azure Load Balancer and Backup Scenario
Scenario Overview: A company, WebServe Solutions, operates two critical applications that are hosted on separate virtual machines (VMs) in Azure. To ensure high availability, the company wants to implement an Azure Load Balancer to distribute traffic between the VMs. Additionally, the company needs a robust backup solution to protect the applications and their data, and a logging mechanism to store and monitor application logs for operational insights and troubleshooting.
Your task as an Azure Administrator is to design and demonstrate how to implement these requirements by using an Azure Load Balancer for traffic distribution, setting up an auto-mated backup solution, and configuring log storage for the two applications.
Goals:
1.	Implement Azure Load Balancer: Demonstrate the configuration and usage of Az-ure Load Balancer to evenly distribute traffic between the two applications hosted on separate virtual machines.
2.	Backup Solution for Applications: Design and implement a backup strategy for both applications to ensure data protection and easy recovery in case of failure.
3.	Store Application Logs: Set up a logging solution to capture and store application logs, ensuring that logs are accessible for monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing purposes.
Student Notes:
•	Load Balancer Configuration: Set up an Azure Load Balancer to distribute incom-ing traffic between the two VMs hosting the applications. Consider configuring health probes to monitor the health of each VM, ensuring traffic is only directed to healthy instances.
•	Application Backup Strategy: You must design a backup plan for the two applica-tions running on the VMs.
•	Logging and Monitoring: Implement a solution to collect, store, and manage logs for both applications.
Important Considerations:
•	Load Balancer Design: Consider the different types of load balancers (public and in-ternal) based on the applications' requirements.
•	Backup Solution: The backup solution must ensure that both the applications and the VMs they are hosted on are protected. This includes VM snapshots, application-level backups, and database backups if necessary.
•	Log Management: Ensure that logs from both VMs are stored in a centralized loca-tion.
•	Cost Optimization
Expectations:
•	Load Balancer Demonstration: Students should demonstrate how Azure Load Bal-ancer works by configuring it to distribute traffic across the two VMs.  
•	Backup Solution Implementation: They must demonstrate how to schedule backups and how to restore applications or VMs from backups in case of failure.
•	Log Storage and Monitoring: Students should set up a logging solution that cap-tures application and system logs from both VMs. Scenario Summary:
In this scenario, students will design and implement a highly available solution using Azure Load Balancer, ensure data protection with a robust backup solution, and set up centralized log storage and monitoring for the applications hosted on Azure VMs.
