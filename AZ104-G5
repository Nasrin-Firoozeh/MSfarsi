 Web Service Design:
Hosting 2 Apps on Azure VMs:
Configuration:

Use two separate Azure VMs (VM1 and VM2).
Install IIS (Internet Information Services) on both VMs.
Host a small HTML page on each VM to show the content (e.g., "VM1 is online" and "VM2 is online").
No need for a separate Azure Storage account since the websites are hosted directly on IIS.
Availability Set:

Place both VMs in the same Availability Set to ensure high availability within an Azure region.
This minimizes downtime during Azure updates or failures.
Scale Set Decision:

A Virtual Machine Scale Set is not necessary due to the static nature of the web pages and the cost consideration.
Alternative (Web App Service):

Using Azure App Service instead of VMs can be considered for reduced cost and management overhead, as it's a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). However, it depends on the customer's preference for VM-based hosting.
Storage for Database:
If the apps require a database:
Use Azure SQL Database (PaaS) for better performance and lower management costs compared to hosting a database on VMs.
Alternatively, host a database on one of the VMs if budget constraints are strict, though this is less secure and scalable.
2. Azure Load Balancer:
Public Load Balancer:
Use a Public Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic between VM1 and VM2.

Configuration Steps:

Create a Public Load Balancer in Azure.
Add both VMs to the Backend Pool.
Configure a Health Probe (e.g., HTTP/TCP on Port 80) to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy VMs.
Set up a Load Balancing Rule to direct traffic across the two VMs.
Security Considerations:

Use Network Security Groups (NSGs) to restrict traffic to specific IP ranges or ports.
Ensure only HTTP/HTTPS traffic is allowed.
3. Robust Backup Solution:
VM and Application-Level Backup:
Use Azure Backup with a Recovery Services Vault (RSV).
Configuration Steps:
Create a Recovery Services Vault in Azure.
Define a Backup Policy:
Schedule daily backups.
Retain backups for 30 days or per requirements.
Add both VMs to the backup policy.
Perform Application-Consistent Snapshots to ensure database and app integrity during backups.
Database Backups:
If using Azure SQL Database, enable Point-in-Time Restore to handle database backups automatically.
For on-VM databases, include them in the VM-level backups or set up separate database backups using tools like SQL Server Management Studio.
Restore Process:
From the Recovery Services Vault, restore entire VMs, files, or applications as needed.
4. Centralized Log Management:
Log Analytics Workspace:
Create an Azure Log Analytics Workspace to collect logs from VMs and applications.
Azure Monitor Agent:
Install the Azure Monitor Agent on both VMs:
It collects operating system logs, performance metrics, and application logs.
Send logs to the Log Analytics Workspace for centralized monitoring.
Use Cases:
Operational Insights:
Monitor VM health, disk usage, and network activity.
Troubleshooting:
Analyze application errors or crashes by querying logs in the workspace.
Auditing:
Keep a record of system events and access logs for compliance.
Decision Summary:
Cost Considerations:

Use a Public Load Balancer and Availability Set instead of a Scale Set to reduce costs.
Avoid additional storage accounts unless the apps need databases.
Consider Azure App Service if long-term costs for VMs outweigh benefits.
Security Measures:

Use NSGs, application-level firewalls, and secure database connections.
Encrypt backups and restrict access to Recovery Services Vault.
This design balances cost and security while meeting high availability and data protection requirements.
